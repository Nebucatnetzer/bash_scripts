# journal
Two simple scripts for making a text file based journal.
nje.sh (new journal entry) creates a new text file in in ~/Dropbox/Apps/Plain.txt/ with the current date and time.
mcj.sh (merge complete journal) creates a text file with the current month as the name and copies 
the content of all the journal entries into it. The file names are the headline for each entry.
